# Game-Project-
Tic Tac Toe Game Project


### Planning Story 
when I first found out what the project was I freaked out. Building games are so scarey to me, once I made my wireframe and relized
this game was very similar to some previous lessons I was able to calm down and relax. I've had a lot of up's and down's
during the project but i can say there was more up's and every small victory i accepted it so i didnt get overly stressed.
After my initial freakout i told my self to just stay calm and keep a level head because the calmer you are the easier it 
will be to figure out the problems and get unstuck, I also vowed to myself to not be affraid to ask for help.

### User Stories

- As a user I want to be able to see win lose or tie 
- As a user I want to be able to start a new game after one has been played
- As a user i would like to be able to sign out 


### Technologies Used 
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- Ajax 
- jQuery


### Unsolved Problems
- I still need to work on getting my new game button to start a new game also getting my game board to recognize when the game board is full so you cant click a box to add X or O and also getting sign in to clear the email and password.
- I would like to add in the future some more cool functionailty like adding an AI and adding a quick game function also i would like add some cool styling like when you over a box in the game boared is changes color so you will know what box you are choosing.
